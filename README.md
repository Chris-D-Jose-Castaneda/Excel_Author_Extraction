# Excel_Author_Extraction

Excel_Author_Extraction is a .NET console app that extracts .xlsx files from a ZIP archive and reads their author metadata. It prompts you for the ZIP file path and the folder to extract into. It scans all extracted Excel files (including subfolders) and prints each workbookâ€™s creator, last modifier, and modification date. Build with dotnet build and run with dotnet run.

I used this for the classes where I was the lead assistant to ensure author origin coressponded with recipient. Created last year ~ May 2024
